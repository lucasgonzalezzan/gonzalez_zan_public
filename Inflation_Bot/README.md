This is a Telegram Bot designed to gather official information from https://datos.gob.ar/ via API.


## Features

The bot accepts the following commands from any Telegram chat:

- /start 	---	Welcome message
- /help  	---	Bring up inline keyboard with commands
- /update  	---	Update Argentina's inflation rate "IPC" from datos.gob.ar
- /raw - Verify IPC downloaded data, asks for how many months ago
- /time  	---	Return current date and time in Argentina
- /calcanual   --- Calculate the cumulative inflation in last year, semester and trimester
- /calcmeses  ---	Same as /calcanual  but asks for the period in months
- /promedio --- Calculate the average inflation per month for the year, semester and trimester
- /project --- Calculate the average inflation per month [^1] in a given periods an returns the inflation in next months/years, assuming constant inflation for each month
- /info --- Return this source code link

[^1]: The average is computed as the root, with radix the number of months, of the total inflation (radicand) ---> 
^months^âˆš~total~  . In other words, a constant inflation of the average over the period of months results in the given total inflation.
